### jobListInsideFolder(folderName) - Returns a list of job full names inside the found folder and its subfolders
```groovy 
    def jobList = jobListInsideFolder('Project/NextFolder') 
```

Would return something like this
```groovy 
    [
        'Project/NextFolder/Job 1', 
        'Project/NextFolder/Job 2',    
        'Project/NextFolder/SubFolder/Job 3' 
    ] 
```
